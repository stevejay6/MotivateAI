# Describe App Pages Plan

## Steps

1. **catalog-pages** – Confirm every routed page by listing `page.tsx` files under `app/` (e.g., `app/page.tsx`, `app/quotes/page.tsx`).
2. **analyze-pages** – Skim each page component (quotes, affirmations, AI tools, journal, etc.) plus helper views such as `app/ai-motivate-me-now/AIMotivateMeNowView.tsx` to capture key interactions, outbound calls (Supabase queries, fetches to `/api/*`, OpenAI-style prompts), and the overall vibe.
3. **write-descriptions** – Produce a teen-friendly summary for every page that explains what it does, how it feels, how it talks to data/AI services, and which database tables/columns should support it.
